In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from, or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.Several industries are involving and implementing blockchain, and as the use of blockchain technology increases, so too does the demand for skilled professionals.From a birds eye view, a blockchain developer specializes in developing and implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology.The average yearly salary of a blockchain developer is ?469K."

The spices and other ingredients remain the same, however the method of preparation involves more time.It is usually accompanied with Dahi ki Chutney, Raita (a yogurt dish) or Mirchi ka Salan.There are 2 styles of preparing this variety.The Katchi Biryani is prepared with the Katchi Yakhni method(with raw gravy). The raw meat is marinated in curd and cooked only by the dum, or the baking process, which is done with rice.This is a challenging process as it requires meticulously measured time and heat to avoid overcooking or undercooking the meat.In Pakki Biryani, where the meat is cooked with all the accompanying spices and then the rice is simmered with the resultant gravy redolent of mace, ittar and kewra in a sealed vessel with saffron and cardamom.It is accompanied by side dishes like Mirchi ka Salan, Dhansak and Bagara Baingan.The meat used in the preparation is usually mutton, beef - popularly called Kalyani Biryani - or, less frequently, chicken."

Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest out of four primary strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as for training."

The blending of mughlai and Andhra cuisines in the kitchen of the Nizam (leader of the historical Hyderabad state), resulted in a dish called the Hyderabad Biryani. It, like other biryanis, is made using Basmati rice which is only found on the Indian subcontinent. The spices and other ingredients remain the same, however the method of preparation involves more time.It is usually accompanied with Dahi ki Chutney, Raita(a yogurt dish) or Mirchi ka Salan.There are 2 styles of preparing this variety.The Katchi Biryani is prepared with the Katchi Yakhni method(with raw gravy). The raw meat is marinated in curd and cooked only by the dum, or the baking process, which is done with rice.This is a challenging process as it requires meticulously measured time and heat to avoid overcooking or undercooking the meat.In Pakki Biryani, where the meat is cooked with all the accompanying spices and then the rice is simmered with the resultant gravy redolent of mace, ittar and kewra in a sealed vessel with saffron and cardamom.It is accompanied by side dishes like Mirchi ka Salan, Dhansak and Bagara Baingan.The meat used in the preparation is usually mutton, beef - popularly called Kalyani Biryani - or, less frequently, chicken."

                "description": "Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.[2] A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.[3] The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.[4]"

"description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.AI applications include advanced web search engines(e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech(such as Siri and Alexa), self - driving cars(e.g., Waymo), automated decision - making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems(such as chess and Go).[1] As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, [3] having become a routine technology"
